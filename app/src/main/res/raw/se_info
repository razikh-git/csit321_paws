PAWS uses an implementation of the Mini-IPIP survey to get an understanding of your decision-making process and behaviour while involved in outdoors activities.

You are encouraged to answer each question honestly, with regard to how you see yourself in the present.

After you complete the survey, the results will be graded to reveal your BIG5 personality profile. Your results are localised to this device, and are used only within the scope of the notifications delivery system.
