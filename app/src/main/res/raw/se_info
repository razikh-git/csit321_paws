This test measures your BIG5 personality, one of the most popular scientific measures of personality.

You will see 20 statements, one at a time, and you will be asked to evaluate the extent to which you agree with them.

Please answer honestly with regard to how you see yourself in the present moment, not how you would like to be in the future. There are no incorrect answers nor any personality profile that is inherently more desirable than another.
